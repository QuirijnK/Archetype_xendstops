# Archetype_xendstops
These are two X endstop mounts for the armchair engineering archetype toolhead system. 
Instead of mounting on the location where the washers clamp the underside of the mgn12 block, they mount to the probe block. Its also available as a replacement probe spacer.

Its compatible with:
- all lengths of klicky
- all lenghts of klickyPCB
- all lengths of euclid.
No beacon unfortunately, except with the spacer. (although no guarantees if that would work either, i have no idea how beacon works)

It uses two m3x18 instead of the usual m3x16 to mount. M3x20 with some washers works well too (the probe mount is 3mm thick)

The probe spacer has an integrated support block due to the required printing orientation. The endstop mount should stick out upwards.

I havent run it in an actual printer yet but the test prints seem to work well for me. Let me know if you have any issues :)
